In the 1948 landmark paper, Shannon proposed using a Markov chain to create a statistical model of the sequences of letters in a piece of English text. Markov chains are now widely used in speech recognition, handwriting recognition, information retrieval, data compression, and spam filtering. They also have many scientific computing applications including the genemark algorithm for gene prediction, the Metropolis algorithm for measuring thermodynamical properties, and Google's PageRank algorithm for web search. For this assignment, we are generating stylized pseudo-random text, to understand Markov Models beter

Markov Models of different orders(k-gram string) predict the next letter depending on the current state of text, Our aim is to automate and make a statistical model to predict letters depending on the probabilities of different letters encountered while processing the piece of text.

You can find details and function of each class in the comments of the java code.
